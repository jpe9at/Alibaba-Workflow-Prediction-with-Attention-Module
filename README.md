This project concerns the 2023 Alibaba clusterdata, obtainable \href{https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata/tree/master/cluster-trace-gpu-v2023}{here}. The dataset consists of 8152 tasks submitted to the GPU cluster of Alibaba's Cloud center. The tasks are specified by the requested resources, in \textit{number of CPUs}, \textit{number of GPUs}, and \textit{amount of memory}. Further specifications are \textit{Quality of Service}, \textit{specific GPU}s requested, \textit{pod phase} (specified as Succeeded, Running, Pending, Failed), and c\textit{reation/deletion/scheduled} times. From this data, six six time series were obtained: \textit{overall CPU}, \textit{overall GPU}, and \textit{overall memory usage} for a given time step, as well as the CPU, GPU, and memory requirements of pods that \textit{started} at that time step  (figure \ref{subfig:subfig1}). Each time step is a millisecond starting from Jan 1st 2023. 

A significant change in workload and frequency of newly arriving pods is observable after day 115. Therefore, for the time series prediction task, introduced in the next section, only the data after the 115th day was used. This data was collected into intervals of 2 minutes, and a moving average was calculated using a window of 15 days for both the collective and the newly scheduled requirements (figure \ref{subfig:subfig2}).
